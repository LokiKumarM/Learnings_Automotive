The ECU takes input from the steering wheel angle, steering torque, and vehicle speed to provide assistive torque to the driver and adjust the steering angle at the wheels.\n",

      "The requirement can be broken down into three main sections:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Steering Wheel Angle**: The ECU shall process the steering wheel angle input, which can range from Â±450Â° (effective within Â±180Â°), and adjust the steering angle at the wheels by 8Â° for every 90Â° of steering wheel input. The ECU shall also provide assistive torque ranging from 1Nm to 15Nm based on the steering wheel angle and vehicle speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Steering Torque**: The ECU shall respond to the torque applied by the driver to the steering wheel, which can range from 0-15Nm, and generate assistive torque up to a 4:1 assist ratio. The ECU shall also adjust the steering angle to ensure the appropriate turning radius, typically ranging from 4-6 meters for parking scenarios and 5-10 meters for normal driving.\n",

      "3. **Vehicle Speed**: The ECU shall adjust the steering assist torque based on the vehicle's speed, which can range from 0 km/h to 200 km/h. The ECU shall provide a higher assist torque at low speeds (under 20 km/h) and gradually decrease the assist torque as the vehicle speed increases, providing a firmer steering feel at high speeds (above 80 km/h).\n",

      "\n",
      "The given requirement is related to the Steering Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of a vehicle, which is responsible for controlling and managing the vehicle's steering system. The requirement can be broken down into four main aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Smooth and Precise Control**: The Steering ECU shall provide smooth and precise control of the steering angle to ensure accurate alignment with driver input. This implies that the ECU should be able to accurately translate the driver's steering input into the corresponding steering angle at the wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Response Time**: The system shall respond to driver input with a maximum response time of less than 10ms to maintain steering precision and vehicle stability. This means that the ECU should be able to process the driver's input and adjust the steering angle within 10ms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Steering Angle Adjustment**: The ECU shall adjust the wheel steering angle within a range of 8Â° at the wheels for every 90Â° of steering wheel input, based on the steering ratio (e.g., 15:1). This implies that the ECU should be able to accurately calculate the required steering angle based on the steering wheel input and the steering ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assistive Torque**: The ECU shall apply assistive torque ranging from 1Nm (for high-speed driving) to up to 15Nm (for low-speed maneuvers such as parking) to reduce driver effort. This implies that the ECU should be able to adjust the assistive torque based on the driving speed and steering input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the requirement is focused on ensuring that the Steering ECU provides accurate, smooth, and precise control of the steering angle, with a fast response time, to maintain steering precision and vehicle stability.\n",

      "\n",
      "The given requirement is related to the Steering Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of a vehicle, which is responsible for controlling and managing the vehicle's steering system. The requirement can be broken down into four main aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Maximum Assist Torque Output**: The Steering ECU shall support a maximum assist torque output of 10Nm. This means that the ECU should be able to provide a maximum of 10Nm of assistive torque to the steering system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consistent Performance under Varying Load Conditions**: The ECU shall maintain consistent performance under varying load conditions. This implies that the ECU should be able to adjust the assist torque output based on the vehicle's speed, load, and other factors to ensure consistent steering performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Speed-based Assist Torque Adjustment**: The ECU shall adjust the steering assist torque based on the vehicle's speed to enhance stability and control. This means that the ECU should provide more assist torque at low speeds (e.g., 5-10Nm) and less assist torque at high speeds (e.g., 1-2Nm) to provide a firmer steering feel and enhance vehicle stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Driver Input-based Assist Torque Generation**: The ECU shall respond to the torque applied by the driver to the steering wheel by generating assistive torque and adjusting the steering angle to facilitate vehicle maneuvering. This means that the ECU should generate an assistive torque up to a 4:1 assist ratio based on the driver's input torque and adjust the steering angle to ensure the appropriate turning radius.\n",
