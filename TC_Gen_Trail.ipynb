      "The requirement can be broken down into four main aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Steering Angle Adjustment**: The ECU adjusts the wheel steering angle within a range of 8° for every 90° of steering wheel input, based on the steering ratio (e.g., 15:1). This ensures proper wheel alignment and vehicle maneuverability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assistive Torque Application**: The ECU applies assistive torque ranging from 1Nm (for high-speed driving) to up to 15Nm (for low-speed maneuvers such as parking) to reduce driver effort. The assistive torque is adjusted based on the driving speed and steering input.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Speed-Dependent Assistive Torque**: The ECU adjusts the assistive torque based on the vehicle's speed to enhance stability and control. At low speeds (under 20 km/h), the system provides a higher assist torque (5-10Nm) for ease of maneuvering, and gradually decreases the assist torque to 1-2Nm at high speeds (above 80 km/h) to provide a firmer steering feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integration with Automated Parking Assist**: The ECU integrates with Automated Parking Assist to enable precise and controlled steering adjustments for automated parking maneuvers. The system automatically adjusts the steering angle by up to ±30° to follow the required parking trajectory, and applies assist torque in the range of 3-8Nm to ensure controlled and smooth parking.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fully validate and test this requirement, the following tests can be performed:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Measure and verify the steering angle adjustment within the expected range (8° per 90° of steering wheel input) for correct wheel alignment.\n",
      "* Validate the assistive torque application within the expected range (1Nm to 15Nm) based on driving speed and steering input.\n",
      "* Perform functional testing with varying steering inputs and vehicle speeds to confirm proper assistive torque generation and adjustment of the turning radius.\n",
      "* Measure and verify the assistive torque at different vehicle speeds to ensure the gradual reduction in torque as speed increases (5-10Nm at low speeds, 1-2Nm at high speeds).\n",
      "* Perform stability testing under varying speed conditions to ensure driver control is maintained.\n",
      "* Verify the steering angle adjustments during parking to ensure proper vehicle alignment (±30°).\n",

The system shall generate an assistive torque up to a 4:1 assist ratio, meaning for every 2Nm of torque applied by the driver, the system shall generate up to 8Nm of assist torque.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Steering Angle Adjustment**: The ECU shall adjust the steering angle to ensure the appropriate turning radius, which ranges from 4-6 meters for parking scenarios and 5-10 meters for normal driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Speed-based Steering Assist**: The ECU shall adjust the steering assist torque based on the vehicle's speed to enhance stability and control. At low speeds (under 20 km/h), the system shall provide a higher assist torque (5-10Nm) for ease of maneuvering, and as the vehicle speed increases, the assist torque shall gradually decrease to a range of 1-2Nm at high speeds (above 80 km/h) to provide a firmer steering feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integration with Automated Parking Assist**: The ECU shall integrate with Automated Parking Assist to enable precise and controlled steering adjustments for automated parking maneuvers. The system shall automatically adjust the steering angle by up to ±30° to follow the required parking trajectory and apply assist torque in the range of 3-8Nm to ensure controlled and smooth parking.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Apply varying torque inputs (0-15Nm) to the steering wheel and measure the generated assistive torque to verify the 4:1 assist ratio.\n",
      "* Measure the steering angle adjustments during normal driving and parking scenarios to verify the turning radius ranges (4-6 meters for parking and 5-10 meters for normal driving).\n",
      "* Test the system at different vehicle speeds (0-200 km/h) to verify the gradual reduction in assist torque as speed increases (5-10Nm at low speeds, 1-2Nm at high speeds).\n",
      "* Perform automated parking maneuvers and measure the steering angle adjustments and assist torque to verify proper vehicle alignment (±30°) and controlled parking (3-8Nm assist torque).\n",
